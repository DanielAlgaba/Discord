Introduction
----------
This is my first discord bot. It is inspired by the fictional character of the Halo series called Avery Johnson. It is only for learning purposes.

How to use
-----------
The bot only responds to certain commands that start with ".". These responses vary from iconic lines to stats from the Master Chief Collection multiplayer.

Currently the bot will only work if I run it, so if you add it to your server it will not work.

If you want to make a bot similar to this, you will need to change "DISCORD_TOKEN" with your own bot token and "HALODOt_API" with your own api token from https://developers.halodotapi.com/ .
