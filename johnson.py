    "You heard the lady! Move like you've got a purpose!",
    "All you greenhorns who wanted to see Covenant up close... this is your lucky day.",
    "It's a mess, sir. We're scattered all over this valley. We called for evac, but until you showed up, I thought we were cooked.",
    "Hit it, Marines—go, go, go! The Corps ain't payin' us by the hour!",
    "Don't even THINK about it, Marine!",
    "Goddamnit Jenkins, fire your weapon!",
    "Come here, you mother… Famu… Giveitere… Ah...",
    "Oh, shi—",
    "This is it, baby. Hold me.",
    "Men, keep your eyes downrange, fingers on the triggers, and we all come home in one piece. Am I right, Marines?",
    "Once again, it is our job to finish what the flyboys started. We are leaving this ship's platoon, and engaging the Covenant on solid ground. When we meet the enemy, we will rip their skulls from their spines, and toss 'em away, laughin'! Am I right, Marines?",
    "Men, here's where we show those split-chin, squid-head, sons of bitches that they could not have picked a worse enemy than the human race. We are going to blow the hell out of those dumb bugs until we don't have anything left to shoot 'em with! And then, we are going to strangle them with their own living guts! Am I right, Marines?",
    "Men, we led those dumb bugs out to the middle of nowhere to keep 'em from gettin' their filthy claws on Earth. But, we stumbled onto somethin' they're so hot for, that they're scramblin' over each other to get it. Well, I don't care if it's God's own anti-son-of-a-bitch machine, or a giant hula hoop, we're not gonna let 'em have it! What we will let 'em have is a belly full of lead, and a pool of their own blood to drown in! Am I right, Marines?",
    "Get up, SO I CAN KILL YOU AGAIN!",
    "Roadkill!",
    "Why me...?",
    "School is now in session!",
    "There's no stopping me!",
    "Say hello to my little friend!",
    "Leave some for me!",
    "You mind not killin' my men?!",
    "You monkeys almost look like soldiers there!",
    "I'm proud of you, Marines!",
    "Marines, we are going to aid John-117 after he just saved your sorry asses!",
    "Ah, man, I just had the thing washed!",
    "You're almost a man!",
    "Who's the man?",
    "Just you and me now.",
    "One down, 50 billion to go!",
    "Do I owe you money?!",
    "Sorry, soldier",
    "Don't get cocky!",
    "Where are your glasses, boy?",
    "Stop whining!",
    "We did bring enough ammo to kill these things!",
    "No peeking!",
    "Headshot!",
    "We could use your help, sir!",
    "I'm too pretty to die!",
    "Don't make me take off my belt!",
    "I would have been your daddy but the dog beat me over the fence!",
    "Earth isn't going to save itself, Chief, it's time to step up to the plate, are you, or are you not going to finish the fight?",
    "Lets go!",
    "Fan out and search!",
    "All quiet",
    "Punch it!",
    "Covering fire!",
    "I can't get a clear shot!",
    "Move!",
    "Get out of my way!",
    "Get the lead out Marines!",
    "Hey, move your ass!",
    "Triggers down, men!",
    "Sorry about that sir",
    "Can't run...",
    "Next",
    "Come on!",
    "Keep it up!",
    "Its down!",
    "We showed them",
